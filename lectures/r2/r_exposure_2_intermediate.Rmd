# Setup

To give us something to visualize, we'll load the `gapminder` data from the last unit. We'll also load `dplyr` to give us tools to manipulate it for visualization--and later, to summarize, tidy, and join data.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
China <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "China")
head(China, 4)
```

# `ggplot2`

An alternative way of plotting many prefer (myself included)<sup>1</sup> uses the `ggplot2` package in R, which is part of the `tidyverse`.

.footnote[[1] [Though this is not without debate](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/11/why-i-dont-use-ggplot2/)]

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

The core idea underlying this package is the [**layered grammar of graphics**](https://doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098): we can break up elements of a plot into pieces and combine them.

# Structure of a ggplot

`ggplot2` graphics objects consist of two primary components:

--

1. **Layers**, the components of a graph.

   * We *add* layers to a `ggplot2` object using `+`.
   * This includes lines, shapes, and text.

--

2. **Aesthetics**, which determine how the layers appear.

   * We *set* aesthetics using *arguments* (e.g. `color="red"`) inside layer functions.
   * This includes locations, colors, and sizes.
   * Aesthetics also determine how data *map* to appearances.

---

# Layers

**Layers** are the components of the graph, such as:

* `ggplot()`: initializes `ggplot2` object, specifies input data
* `geom_point()`: layer of scatterplot points
* `geom_line()`: layer of lines
* `ggtitle()`, `xlab()`, `ylab()`: layers of labels
* `facet_wrap()`: layer creating separate panels stratified by some factor wrapping around
* `facet_grid()`: same idea, but can split by two variables along rows and columns (e.g. `facet_grid(gender ~ age_group)`)
* `theme_bw()`: replace default gray background with black-and-white

Layers are separated by a `+` sign. For clarity, I usually put each layer on a new line, unless it takes few or no arguments (e.g. `xlab()`, `ylab()`, `theme_bw()`).

---

# Aesthetics

**Aesthetics** control the appearance of the layers:

* `x`, `y`: $x$ and $y$ coordinate values to use
* `color`: set color of elements based on some data value
* `group`: describe which points are conceptually grouped together for the plot (often used with lines)
* `size`: set size of points/lines based on some data value
* `alpha`: set transparency based on some data value

---

## Aesthetics: Setting vs. mapping

Layers take arguments to control their appearance, such as point/line colors or transparency (`alpha` between 0 and 1).

--

* Arguments like `color`, `size`, `linetype`, `shape`, `fill`, and `alpha` can be used directly on the layers (**setting aesthetics**), e.g. `geom_point(color = "red")`. See the [`ggplot2` documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/vignettes/ggplot2-specs.html) for options. These *don't depend on the data*.

--

* Arguments inside `aes()` (**mapping aesthetics**) will *depend on the data*, e.g. `geom_point(aes(color = continent))`.

--

* `aes()` in the `ggplot()` layer gives overall aesthetics to use in other layers, but can be changed on individual layers (including switching `x` or `y` to different variables)

--

This may seem pedantic, but precise language makes searching for help easier.

--

Now let's see all this jargon in action.

# Storing Plots

We can assign a `ggplot` object to a name:

```{r}
lifeExp_by_year <- 
  ggplot(data = gapminder, 
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, 
           group = country, 
           color = continent)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Life expectancy") +
  ggtitle("Life expectancy over time") +
  theme_bw() + 
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The graph won't be displayed when you do this. You can show the graph using a single line of code with just the object name, *or take the object and add more layers*.

---

# Showing a Stored Graph

```{r, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
lifeExp_by_year
```

---

## Adding a Layer

```{r, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
lifeExp_by_year +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

---
# Changing the Axes

We can modify the axes in a variety of ways, such as:

* Change the $x$ or $y$ range using `xlim()` or `ylim()` layers

* Change to a logarithmic or square-root scale on either axis: `scale_x_log10()`, `scale_y_sqrt()`

* Change where the major/minor breaks are: `scale_x_continuous(breaks =, minor_breaks = )`

---
# Axis Changes

```{r, fig.height=3.5, dev='svg'}
ggplot(data = China, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_y_log10(breaks = c(1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000), #<<
                  labels = scales::dollar) + #<<
    xlim(1940, 2010) + ggtitle("Chinese GDP per capita")
```

---
# Saving `ggplot` Plots

When you knit an R Markdown file, any plots you make are automatically saved in the "figure" folder in `.png` format. If you want to save another copy (perhaps of a different file type for use in a manuscript), use `ggsave()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggsave("I_saved_a_file.pdf", plot = lifeExp_by_year,
       height = 3, width = 5, units = "in")
```

If you didn't manually set font sizes, these will usually come out at a reasonable size given the dimensions of your output file.

**Bad/non-reproducible way**<sup>1</sup>: choose *Export* on the plot preview or take a screenshot / snip.

# Summarizing Data

---
## General Aggregation: `summarize()`

**`summarize()`** takes your column(s) of data and computes something using every row: 

* Count how many rows there are
* Calculate the mean
* Compute the sum
* Obtain a minimum or maximum value

You can use any function in `summarize()` that aggregates *multiple values* into a *single value* (like `sd()`, `mean()`, or `max()`).


---
# `summarize()` Example

Remember our Yugoslavia example from last unit?

.smallish[
```{r}
yugoslavia <- gapminder %>% filter(country %in% c("Bosnia and Herzegovina",
               "Croatia", "Macedonia", "Montenegro", "Serbia", "Slovenia"))
```
]

For the year 1982, let's get the *number of observations*, *total population*, *mean life expectancy*, and *range of life expectancy* for former Yugoslavian countries.

.smallish[
```{r}
yugoslavia %>% filter(year == 1982) %>%
    summarize(n_obs = n(),
              total_pop = sum(pop),
              mean_life_exp = mean(lifeExp),
              range_life_exp = max(lifeExp) - min(lifeExp))
```
]

These new variables are calculated using *all of the rows* in `yugoslavia`

---
# Avoiding Repetition

### `summarize(across())`


Maybe you need to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a bunch of columns. With **`across()`**, put the variables to compute over first (using `c()` or `select()` syntax) and put the functions to use in a `list()` after.

.smallish[
```{r}
yugoslavia %>%
  filter(year == 1982) %>%
  summarize(across(c(lifeExp, pop), list(avg = ~mean(.), sd = ~sd(.))))
```
]

Note it automatically names the summarized variables based on the names given in `list()`.

---
# Whoa, too many `(` and `)`

It can get hard to read code with lots of **nested** functions--functions inside others.

Break things up when it gets confusing!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
yugoslavia %>%
  filter(year == 1982) %>%
  summarize(
    across( 
      c(lifeExp, pop), 
      list(
        avg = ~mean(.), 
        sd = ~sd(.)
      )
    )
  )
```

RStudio also helps you by tracking parentheses: Put your cursor after a `)` and see!

---
# Avoiding Repetition

There are additional ways to use `across()` for repetitive operations:

* `across(everything())` will summarize / mutate *all* variables sent to it in the same way. For instance, getting the mean and standard deviation of an entire dataframe:

.smallish[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dataframe %>% 
  summarize(across(everything(), list(mean = ~mean(.), sd = ~sd(.))))
```
]

* `across(where())` will summarize / mutate all variables that satisfy some logical condition. For instance, summarizing every numeric column in a dataframe at once:

.smallish[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dataframe %>% 
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), list(mean = ~mean(.), sd = ~sd(.))))
```
]

You can use all of these to avoid typing out the same code repeatedly!

---
# `group_by()`


The special function **`group_by()`** changes how subsequent functions operate on the data, most importantly `summarize()`.

Functions after `group_by()` are computed *within each group* as defined by unique valus of the variables given, rather than over all rows at once.

Typically the variables you group by will be integers, factors, or characters, and *not continuous real values*.

---
# `group_by()` example


```{r}
yugoslavia %>%
  group_by(year) %>% #<<
    summarize(num_countries = n_distinct(country),
              total_pop = sum(pop),
              total_gdp_per_cap = sum(pop*gdpPercap)/total_pop) %>%
    head(5)
```

Because we did `group_by()` with `year` then used `summarize()`, we get *one row per value of `year`*!

Each value of year is its own **group**!

---
## Window Functions

Grouping can also be used with `mutate()` or `filter()` to give rank orders within a group, lagged values, and cumulative sums. You can read more about window functions in this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html).

```{r}
yugoslavia %>% 
  select(country, year, pop) %>%
  filter(year >= 2002) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(lag_pop = lag(pop, order_by = year),
         pop_chg = pop - lag_pop) %>%
  head(4)
```

# Initial Spot Checks

.smallish[
First things to check after loading new data:
]
--

.smallish[
* Did the last rows/columns from the original file make it in?

    + May need to use different package or manually specify range
]
--

.smallish[
* Are the column names in good shape?

    + Modify a `col_names=` argument or fix with `rename()`
]
--
.smallish[

* Are there "decorative" blank rows or columns to remove?

    + `filter()` or `select()` out those rows/columns
]
--
.smallish[

* How are missing values represented: `NA`, `" "` (blank), `.` (period), `999`?

    + Use `mutate()` with `ifelse()` to fix these (perhaps *en masse* with looping)
]
--
.smallish[

* Are there character data (e.g. ZIP codes with leading zeroes) being incorrectly represented as numeric or vice versa?

    + Modify `col_types=` argument, or use `mutate()` and `as.numeric()`
]

# Billboard Data

We're going to work with some *ugly* data: *The Billboard Hot 100 for the year 2000*.

We can load it like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr) # Contains read_csv()
billboard_2000_raw <- 
  read_csv(file = "https://github.com/clanfear/Intermediate_R_Workshop/raw/master/data/billboard.csv",
           col_types = paste(c("icccD", rep("i", 76)), collapse="")) #<<
```

```{r, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr) # Contains read_csv()
billboard_2000_raw <- 
  read_csv(file = "../../data/billboard.csv",
           col_types = paste(c("icccD", rep("i", 76)), collapse="")) #<<
```

.footnote[`col_types=` is used to specify column types. [See here for details.](https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/Lectures/Week5/CSSS508_week5_data_import_export_cleaning.html#29)]

---
# Billboard is Just Ugly-Messy

.small[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(pander)
pander(head(billboard_2000_raw[,1:10], 12), split.tables=120, style="rmarkdown")
```
]

Week columns continue up to `wk76`!

---
# Billboard

* What are the **observations** in the data?

--

    + Week since entering the Billboard Hot 100 per song
--

* What are the **variables** in the data?
--

    + Year, artist, track, song length, date entered Hot 100, week since first entered Hot 100 (**spread over many columns**), rank during week (**spread over many columns**)
--

* What are the **values** in the data?
--

    + e.g. 2000; 3 Doors Down; Kryptonite; 3 minutes 53 seconds; April 8, 2000; Week 3 (**stuck in column headings**); rank 68 (**spread over many columns**)

---
# Tidy Data

**Tidy data** (aka "long data") are such that:

--

1. The values for a single observation are in their own row.
--

2. The values for a single variable are in their own column.
--

3. There is only one value per cell.

--

Why do we want tidy data?

* Easier to understand many rows than many columns
* Required for plotting in `ggplot2`
* Required for many types of statistical procedures (e.g. hierarchical or mixed effects models)
* Fewer confusing variable names
* Fewer issues with missing values and "imbalanced" repeated measures data

---
# `tidyr`

The `tidyr` package provides functions to tidy up data, similar to `reshape` in Stata or `varstocases` in SPSS. Key functions:

--

* **`pivot_longer()`**: takes a set of columns and pivots them down to make two new columns (which you can name yourself): 
    * A `name` column that stores the original column names
    * A `value` with the values in those original columns

--

* **`pivot_wider()`**: inverts `pivot_longer()` by taking two columns and pivoting them up into multiple columns

--

* **`separate()`**: pulls apart one column into multiple columns (common after `pivot_longer()` where values are embedded in column names)
    * `extract_numeric()` does a simple version of this for the common case when you just want grab the number part

--

* **`extract()`** for pivoting a column into multiple *sets* of columns.
   * See [Hadley's response to this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25925556/gather-multiple-sets-of-columns) for an example.

---
# `pivot_longer()`

Let's use `pivot_longer()` to get the week and rank variables out of their current layout into two columns (big increase in rows, big drop in columns):

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
billboard_2000 <- billboard_2000_raw %>%
  pivot_longer(starts_with("wk"), 
               names_to ="week", #<<
               values_to = "rank") #<<
dim(billboard_2000)
```

`starts_with()` and other syntax and helper functions from `dplyr::select()` work here too.

We could instead use: `pivot_longer(wk1:wk76, names_to = "week", values_to = "rank")` to pull out these contiguous columns.

---
# `pivot`ed Weeks

.smallish[
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
head(billboard_2000)
```
]

Now we have a single week column!

---
# Pivoting Better?

```{r}
summary(billboard_2000$rank)
```

This is an improvement, but we don't want to keep the `r sum(is.na(billboard_2000$rank))` rows with missing ranks (i.e. observations for weeks since entering the Hot 100 that the song was no longer on the Hot 100).

---
## Pivoting Better: `values_drop_na`

The argument `values_drop_na = TRUE` to `pivot_longer()` will remove rows with missing ranks.
```{r}
billboard_2000 <- billboard_2000_raw %>%
  pivot_longer(starts_with("wk"), 
               names_to ="week", 
               values_to = "rank", 
               values_drop_na = TRUE) #<<
summary(billboard_2000$rank)
```

No more `NA` values!

```{r}
dim(billboard_2000)
```
And way fewer rows!

---
# `parse_number()`

The week column is character, but should be numeric.

```{r}
summary(billboard_2000$week)
```

--

`tidyr` provides a convenience function to grab just the numeric information from a column that mixes text and numbers:

```{r}
billboard_2000 <- billboard_2000 %>%
    mutate(week = parse_number(week)) #<<
summary(billboard_2000$week)
```

For more sophisticated conversion or pattern checking, you'll need to use string parsing (to be covered in R4).

---
# Or use `names_prefix`

```{r}
billboard_2000 <- billboard_2000_raw %>%
  pivot_longer(starts_with("wk"), 
               names_to ="week", 
               values_to = "rank",
               values_drop_na = TRUE,
               names_prefix = "wk", #<<
               names_transform = list(week = as.integer))  #<<
head(billboard_2000, 3)
```

We use `names_prefix` to remove `"wk"` from the values, and `names_transform` to convert into an integer number. 

---
# `separate()`

The track length column isn't analytically friendly. Let's convert it to a number rather than the character (minutes:seconds) format:

```{r}
billboard_2000 <- billboard_2000 %>%
    separate(time, into = c("minutes", "seconds"),
             sep = ":", convert = TRUE) %>% #<<
    mutate(length = minutes + seconds / 60) %>%
    select(-minutes, -seconds)
summary(billboard_2000$length)
```

`sep = ":"` tells `separate()` to split the column into two where it finds a colon (`:`).

Then we add `seconds / 60` to `minutes` to produce a numeric `length` in minutes.


---
# `pivot_wider()` Motivation

`pivot_wider()` is the opposite of `pivot_longer()`, which you use if you have data for the same observation taking up multiple rows.

--

Example of data that we probably want to pivot wider (unless we want to plot each statistic in its own facet):

.small[
| **Group** | **Statistic** | **Value** |
|-------|-----------|------:|
| A     | Mean      |  1.28 |
| A     | Median    |   1.0 |
| A     | SD        |  0.72 |
| B     | Mean      |  2.81 |
| B     | Median    |     2 |
| B     | SD        |  1.33 |
]

A common cue to use `pivot_wider()` is having measurements of different quantities in the same column. 

---
# Before `pivot_wider()`


```{r}
(too_long_data <- 
   data.frame(Group     = c(rep("A", 3), rep("B", 3)),
              Statistic = rep(c("Mean", "Median", "SD"), 2),
              Value     = c(1.28, 1.0, 0.72, 2.81, 2, 1.33)))
```


---
# After `pivot_wider()`

```{r}
(just_right_data <- too_long_data %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Statistic, values_from = Value))
```

---
# Charts of 2000: Data Prep

Let's look at songs that hit #1 at some point and look how they got there versus songs that did not:

```{r}
billboard_2000 <- billboard_2000 %>%
    group_by(artist, track) %>%
    mutate(`Weeks at #1` = sum(rank == 1),
           `Peak Rank`   = ifelse(any(rank == 1), #<<
                                  "Hit #1",
                                  "Didn't #1")) %>%
    ungroup() #<<
```

Things to note:

* `any(min_rank==1)` checks to see if *any* value of `rank` is equal to one for the given `artist` and `track`

* `ungroup()` here removes the grouping made by `group_by()`.

---
# Charts of 2000: `ggplot2`

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
billboard_trajectories <- 
  ggplot(data = billboard_2000,
         aes(x = week, y = rank, group = track,
             color = `Peak Rank`)
         ) +
  geom_line(aes(size = `Peak Rank`), alpha = 0.4) +
    # rescale time: early weeks more important
  scale_x_log10(breaks = seq(0, 70, 10)) + 
  scale_y_reverse() + # want rank 1 on top, not bottom
  theme_classic() +
  xlab("Week") + ylab("Rank") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "red")) +
  scale_size_manual(values = c(0.25, 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.90, 0.25),
        legend.background = element_rect(fill="transparent"))
```

---
# Charts of 2000: Beauty!

```{r, cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE, dev="svg", fig.height=4}
billboard_trajectories
```

Observation: There appears to be censoring around week 20 for songs falling out of the top 50 that I'd want to follow up on.

---
## Which Were #1 the Most Weeks?

```{r}
billboard_2000 %>%
    select(artist, track, `Weeks at #1`) %>%
    distinct(artist, track, `Weeks at #1`) %>%
    arrange(desc(`Weeks at #1`)) %>%
    head(7)
```

---
# Getting Usable Dates

We have the date the songs first charted, but not the dates for later weeks. We can calculate these now that the data are tidy:

```{r}
billboard_2000 <- billboard_2000 %>%
    mutate(date = date.entered + (week - 1) * 7) #<<
billboard_2000 %>% arrange(artist, track, week) %>%
    select(artist, date.entered, week, date, rank) %>% head(4)
```

This works because `date` objects are in units of days—we just add 7 days per week to the start date.

---
# Preparing to Plot Over Calendar Time

.smallish[
```{r}
plot_by_day <- 
  ggplot(billboard_2000, aes(x = date, y = rank, group = track)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.25, alpha = 0.4) +
  # just show the month abbreviation label (%b)
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b") +
  scale_y_reverse() + theme_bw() +
  # add lines for start and end of year:
  # input as dates, then make numeric for plotting
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date("2000-01-01", "%Y-%m-%d")),
             col = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date("2000-12-31", "%Y-%m-%d")),
             col = "red") +
  xlab("Week") + ylab("Rank")
```
]

---
# Calendar Time Plot!

```{r, echo=FALSE, dev="svg", fig.height=4}
plot_by_day
```

We see some of the entry dates are before 2000---presumably songs still charting during 2000 that came out earlier.

##Joining Data

---
## When Do We Need to Join Data?

* Want to make columns using criteria too complicated for `ifelse()` or `case_when()`

   * We can work with small sets of variables then combine them back together.

* Combine data stored in separate data sets: e.g. UW registrar information with police stop records.

   * Often large surveys are broken into different data sets for each level (e.g. household, individual, neighborhood)

---
## Joining in Concept

We need to think about the following when we want to merge data frames `A` and `B`:

* Which *rows* are we keeping from each data frame?

* Which *columns* are we keeping from each data frame?

* Which variables determine whether rows *match*?

---
## Join Types: Rows and columns kept

There are many types of joins<sup>1</sup>...

* `A %>% left_join(B)`: keep all rows from `A`, matched with `B` wherever possible (`NA` when not), keep columns from both `A` and `B`

* `A %>% right_join(B)`: keep all rows from `B`, matched with `A` wherever possible (`NA` when not), keep columns from both `A` and `B`

* `A %>% inner_join(B)`: keep only rows from `A` and `B` that match, keep columns from both `A` and `B`

* `A %>% full_join(B)`: keep all rows from both `A` and `B`, matched wherever possible (`NA` when not), keep columns from both `A` and `B`

* `A %>% semi_join(B)`: keep rows from `A` that match rows in `B`, keep columns from only `A`

* `A %>% anti_join(B)`: keep rows from `A` that *don't* match a row in `B`, keep columns from only `A`

.pull-right[.footnote[[1] Usually `left_join()` does the job.]]

---
## Matching Criteria

We say rows should *match* because they have some columns containing the same value. We list these in a `by = ` argument to the join.

Matching Behavior:

* No `by`: Match using all variables in `A` and `B` that have identical names

--

* `by = c("var1", "var2", "var3")`: Match on identical values of `var1`, `var2`, and `var3` in both `A` and `B`

--

* `by = c("Avar1" = "Bvar1", "Avar2" = "Bvar2")`: Match identical values of `Avar1` variable in `A` to `Bvar1` variable in `B`, and `Avar2` variable in `A` to `Bvar2` variable in `B`

Note: If there are multiple matches, you'll get *one row for each possible combination* (except with `semi_join()` and `anti_join()`).

Need to get more complicated? Break it into multiple operations.

---
## `nycflights13` Data

We'll use data in the [`nycflights13` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf).

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
```

It includes five dataframes, some of which contain missing data (`NA`):

* `flights`: flights leaving JFK, LGA, or EWR in 2013
* `airlines`: airline abbreviations
* `airports`: airport metadata
* `planes`: airplane metadata
* `weather`: hourly weather data for JFK, LGA, and EWR

Note these are *separate data frames*, each needing to be *loaded separately*:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data(flights)
data(airlines)
data(airports)
# and so on...
```



---
## Join Example 1

Which airlines had the most flights to Seattle from NYC?
```{r}
flights %>% filter(dest == "SEA") %>% 
    select(carrier) %>%
    left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
    count(name) %>% #<<
    arrange(desc(n))
```

`count(name)` is a shortcut for `group_by(name) %>% summarize(n(.))`: It creates a variable `n` equal to the number of rows in each group.

---
## Join Example 2
Who manufactures the planes that flew to SeaTac?

```{r}
flights %>% filter(dest == "SEA") %>% select(tailnum) %>%
    left_join(planes %>% select(tailnum, manufacturer), #<<
              by = "tailnum") %>%
    count(manufacturer) %>% # Count observations by manufacturer
    arrange(desc(n)) # Arrange data descending by count
```

Note you can perform operations on the data inside functions such as `left_join()` and the *output* will be used by the function.

---
## Join Example 3

Is there a relationship between departure delays and wind gusts?

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
flights %>% 
    select(origin, year, month, day, hour, dep_delay) %>%
    inner_join(weather, 
           by = c("origin", "year", "month", "day", "hour")) %>%
    select(dep_delay, wind_gust) %>%
    # removing rows with missing values
    filter(!is.na(dep_delay) & !is.na(wind_gust)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = wind_gust, y = dep_delay)) +
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth()
```

Because the data are the first argument for `ggplot()`, we can pipe them straight into a plot.

## Wind Gusts and Delays

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.height=4, dev='png', dpi=600}
flights %>% select(origin, year, month, day, hour, dep_delay) %>%
    inner_join(weather, by = c("origin", "year", "month", "day", "hour")) %>%
    select(dep_delay, wind_gust) %>%
    # removing rows with missing values
    filter(!is.na(dep_delay) & !is.na(wind_gust)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = wind_gust, y = dep_delay)) +
      geom_point() + geom_smooth()
