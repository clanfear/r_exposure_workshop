# R and RStudio
## A quick orientation

---
# Why R?

R is a programming language built for statistical computing.

If one already knows Excel or Stata, why use R?

--

* R is *free*, so you don't need a terminal server or license.

--

* R has a *very* large community for support and packages.

--

* R can handle virtually any data format.

--

* R makes replication *easy*.

--

* R is a *language* so it can do *everything*.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] Including generate these slides (using RMarkdown)!]
--

* R is similar to other programming languages.

---

# R Studio

R Studio is a "front-end" or integrated development environment (IDE) for R that can make your life *easier*.

--

RStudio can:
--

* Organize your code, output, and plots.

--

* Auto-complete code and highlight syntax.

--

* Help view data and objects.

--

* [Enable easy integration of R code into documents.](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

---
# Getting Started

Open up RStudio now and choose *File > New File > R Script*.

Then, let's get oriented with the interface:

* *Top Left*: Code **editor** pane, data viewer (browse with tabs)

* *Bottom Left*: **Console** for running code (`>` prompt)

* *Top Right*: List of objects in **environment**, code **history** tab.

* *Bottom Right*: Tabs for browsing files, viewing plots, managing packages, and viewing help files.

You can change the layout in *Preferences > Pane Layout*

---

# Editing and Running Code

There are several ways to run R code in RStudio:
--

* Highlight lines in the **editor** window and click *Run* at the top or hit `Ctrl+Enter` or `⌘+Enter` to run them all.

--

* With your **caret** on a line you want to run, hit `Ctrl+Enter` or `⌘+Enter`. Note your caret moves to the next line, so you can run code sequentially with repeated presses. 

--

* Type individual lines in the **console** and press `Enter`.

--

The console will show the lines you ran followed by any printed output.

---

# Incomplete Code

If you mess up (e.g. leave off a parenthesis), R might show a `+` sign prompting you to finish the command:

```{r Coding 1, eval=FALSE}
> (11-2
+
```

Finish the command or hit `Esc` to get out of this.

---

# R as a Calculator

In the **console**, type `123 + 456 + 789` and hit `Enter`.
--

```{r Calc 1}
123 + 456 + 789
```

--

The `[1]` in the output indicates the numeric **index** of the first element on that line.

--

Now in your blank R document in the **editor**, try typing the line `sqrt(400)` and either
clicking *Run* or hitting `Ctrl+Enter` or `⌘+Enter`.

--

```{r Calc 2}
sqrt(400)
```

---

# Functions and Help

`sqrt()` is an example of a **function** in R.

If we didn't have a good guess as to what `sqrt()` will do, we can type `?sqrt` in the console
and look at the **Help** panel on the right.

```{r Help, eval=FALSE}
?sqrt
```

**Arguments** are the *inputs* to a function. In this case, the only argument to `sqrt()`
is `x` which can be a number or a vector of numbers.

Help files provide documentation on how to use functions and what functions produce.

---

# Creating Objects

R stores *everything* as an **object**, including data, functions, models, and output.

--

Creating an object can be done using the **assignment operator**: `<-` 
--

```{r Objects 1}
new.object <- 144
```

--

**Operators** like `<-` are functions that look like symbols but typically sit between their arguments 
(e.g. numbers or objects) instead of having them inside `()` like in `sqrt(x)`<sup>1</sup>. 

.footnote[[1] We can actually call operators like other functions by stuffing them between backticks: <code>\`+\`(x,y)</code>]

--

We do math with operators, e.g., `x + y`. `+` is the addition operator!

---

# Calling Objects

You can display or "call" an object simply by using its name.

```{r Objects 2}
new.object
```

--

Object names can contain `_` and `.` in them, but cannot *begin* with numbers. Try
to be consistent in naming objects. RStudio auto-complete means *long names are better 
than vague ones*! 

*Good names<sup>1</sup> save confusion later.*

.footnote[[1] "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." - Phil Karlton]

---

# Using Objects

An object's **name** represents the information stored in that **object**, so you can treat the object's name
as if it were the values stored inside.
--

```{r Objects 3}
new.object + 10
new.object + new.object
sqrt(new.object)
```

---

# Creating Vectors

A **vector** is a series of **elements**, such as numbers. 

--

You can create a vector and store it as an object in the same way. To do this, use the
function `c()` which stands for "combine" or "concatenate".
--

```{r Vectors 1}
new.object <- c(4, 9, 16, 25, 36)
new.object
```

--

If you name an object the same name as an existing object, *it will overwrite it*.

--

You can provide a vector as an argument for many functions.
--

```{r Vectors 2}
sqrt(new.object)
```

---

# Character Vectors

We often work with data that are categorical. To create a vector of text elements—**strings** in programming terms—we must place the text in quotes:

```{r}
string.vector <- c("Atlantic", "Pacific", "Arctic")
string.vector
```

--

Categorical data can also be stored as a **factor**, which has an underlying numeric representation. Models will convert factors to dummies.<sup>1</sup>

```{r}
factor.vector <- factor(string.vector)
factor.vector
```

.footnote[[1] Factors have **levels** which you can use to set a reference category in models using `relevel()`.]

---
# Saving and Loading Objects

You can save an R object on your computer as a file to open later:
```{r}
save(new.object, file="new_object.RData")
```

--

You can open saved files in R as well:
```{r}
load("new_object.RData")
```

--

But where are these files being saved and loaded from?

---

# Working Directories

R saves files and looks for files to open in your current **working directory**<sup>1</sup>. You
can ask R what this is:

.footnote[[1] For a simple R function to open an Explorer / Finder window at your working directory, [see this StackOverflow response](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12135823/10277284).]

```{r}
getwd()
```

--

Similarly, we can set a working directory like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/cclan/Documents")
```

---

# More Complex Objects

The same principles shown with vectors can be used with more complex objects like **matrices**, **arrays**, **lists**, and **dataframes** (lists which look like matrices but can hold multiple data types at once).

Most data sets you will work with will be read into R and stored as a **dataframe**, so the remainder of this workshop will mainly focus on using these objects.

---
class: inverse 

# Loading Dataframes

---

# Delimited Text Files

The easiest way to work with external data—that isn't in R format—is for it to be stored in a *delimited* text file, e.g. comma-separated values (**.csv**) or tab-separated values (**.tsv**). 

--


R has a variety of built-in functions for importing data stored in text files, like `read.table()` and `read.csv()`.<sup>1</sup>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_df <- read.csv("some_spreadsheet.csv")
```

.footnote[
[1] Use "write" versions (e.g. `write.csv()`) to create these files from R objects.
]


---
# Data from Other Software

Working with **Stata**, **SPSS**, or **SAS** users? You can use a **package** to bring in their saved data files:
 
* `foreign`
    + Part of base R
    + Functions: `read.spss()`, `read.dta()`, `read.xport()`
    + Less complex but sometimes loses some metadata
* `haven`
    + Part of the `tidyverse` family
    + Functions: `read_spss()`, `read_dta()`, `read_sas()`
    + Keeps metadata like variable labels


For less common formats, Google it. I've yet to encounter a data format without an 
R package to handle it (or at least a clever hack).

If you encounter an ambiguous file extension (e.g. `.dat`), try opening it with
a good text editor first (e.g. Atom, Sublime); there's a good chance it is actually raw text
with a delimiter or fixed format that R can handle!

---

# Installing Packages


Packages contain functions (and sometimes data) created by the community. The real power of R is found in add-on packages!

--

This workshop focuses on using packages from the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

--

The `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages which share a design philosophy, syntax, and data structures.

--

The `tidyverse` includes the most used packages in the R world: [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

--

You can install the *entire* `tidyverse` with the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

--

We will also use the `gapminder` and `nycflights13` datasets:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("gapminder")
install.packages("nycflights13")
```

---

# Loading Packages

To load a package, use `library()`:

```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

Once a package is loaded, you can call on functions or data inside it.

```{r}
data(gapminder) # Places data in your global environment
head(gapminder) # Displays first six elements of an object
```

---
class: inverse
# Indexing and Subsetting
## Base R

---

# Indices and Dimensions

In base R, there are two main ways to access elements of objects: square brackets (`[]` or `[[]]`) and `$`. How you access an object depends on its *dimensions*.

--

Dataframes have *2* dimensions: **rows** and **columns**. Square brackets allow us to numerically **subset** in the format of `object[row, column]`. Leaving the row or column place empty selects *all* elements of that dimension.

.small[
```{r}
gapminder[1,] # First row
```
]
--
.small[
```{r}
gapminder[1:3, 3:4] # First three rows, third and fourth column #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
.footnote[
The **colon operator** (`:`) generates a vector using the sequence of integers from its first argument to its second. `1:3` is equivalent to `c(1,2,3)`.
]
]
---

# Dataframes and Names

Columns in dataframes can also be accessed using their names with the `$` extract operator. This will return the column as a vector:

```{r}
gapminder$gdpPercap[1:10]
```

--

Note here I *also* used brackets to select just the first 10 elements of that column.

You can mix subsetting formats! In this case I provided only a single value (no column index) because **vectors** have *only one dimension* (length).

If you try to subset something and get a warning about "incorrect number of dimensions", check your subsetting!

---

# Indexing by Expression

We can also index using expressions—logical *tests*.

```{r}
gapminder[gapminder$year==1952, ]
```

---

# How Expressions Work

What does `gapminder$year==1952` actually do? 

--

```{r}
head(gapminder$year==1952, 50) # display first 50 elements
```

--

It returns a vector of `TRUE` or `FALSE` values.

When used with the subset operator (`[]`), elements for which a `TRUE` is given are returned while those corresponding to `FALSE` are dropped.

---

# Logical Operators

We used `==` for testing "equals": `gapminder$year==1952`.

--

There are many other [logical operators](http://www.statmethods.net/management/operators.html):

--

* `!=`: not equal to
--

* `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`: less than, less than or equal to, etc.
--

* `%in%`: used with checking equal to one of several values

--

Or we can combine multiple logical conditions:

* `&`: both conditions need to hold (AND)
--

* `|`: at least one condition needs to hold (OR)
--

* `!`: inverts a logical condition (`TRUE` becomes `FALSE`, `FALSE` becomes `TRUE`)

--

Logical operators are one of the foundations of programming. You should experiment with these to become familiar with how they work!

---

# Sidenote: Missing Values

Missing values are coded as `NA` entries without quotes:

```{r}
vector_w_missing <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5, 6, NA)
```

Even one `NA` "poisons the well": You'll get `NA` out of your calculations unless you remove them manually or use the extra argument `na.rm = TRUE` in some functions:

```{r}
mean(vector_w_missing)
mean(vector_w_missing, na.rm=TRUE)
```

---
# Finding Missing Values

**WARNING:** You can't test for missing values by seeing if they "equal" (`==`) `NA`:

```{r}
vector_w_missing == NA
```

But you can use the `is.na()` function:

```{r}
is.na(vector_w_missing)
```

We can use subsetting to get the equivalent of `na.rm=TRUE`:

```{r}
mean(vector_w_missing[!is.na(vector_w_missing)]) #<<
```

.pull-right[
.footnote[
`!` *reverses* a logical condition. Read the above as "subset *not* `NA`"
]

# Subsetting Data with `dplyr`

.image-full[
![](img/dplyr.svg)
]

---

# `dplyr`

`dplyr` is a Tidyverse package for working with data frames.

--

It provides an intuitive, powerful, and consistent alternative to base R for subsetting data.

--

It also provides functions for summarizing and joining data which are more straightforward than base R.

--

While I recommend all users be familiar with base R methods I've just covered, `dplyr` is the dominant platform for data manipulation in R, so we will focus on it for the remainder of this unit.

---
# But First, Pipes: `%>%`

`dplyr` uses the [`magrittr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html) forward pipe operator, usually called simply a **pipe**. We write pipes like **`%>%`** (`Ctrl+Shift+M` or `⌘ +Shift+M`).

--

Pipes take the object on the *left* and apply the function on the *right*: `x %>% f(y) = f(x, y)`. Read out loud: "and then..."

--

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
gapminder %>% filter(country == "Canada") %>% head(2)
```

--

Pipes save us typing, make code readable, and allow chaining like above, so we use them *all the time* when manipulating data frames.

---

# Using Pipes


Pipes are clearest to read when you have each function on a separate line.

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}
take_this_data %>%
    do_first_thing(with = this_value) %>%
    do_next_thing(using = that_value) %>% ...
```

--

Stuff to the left of the pipe is passed to the *first argument* of the function on the right. Other arguments go on the right in the function. 

--

If you ever find yourself piping a function where data are not the first argument, use `.` in the data argument instead.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% lm(pop ~ year, data = .)
```

---
# Pipe Assignment

When creating a new object from the output of piped functions, place the assignment operator at the beginning.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lm_pop_year <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Americas") %>%
  lm(pop ~ year, data = .)
```

No matter how long the chain of functions is, assignment is always done at the top.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] Note this is just a stylistic convention: If you prefer, you *can* do assignment at the end of the chain.]

---

# `filter()` Data Frames

I used **`filter()`** earlier. We subset *rows* of data using logical conditions with `filter()`!

```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(country == "Oman") %>% head(8)
```

What is this doing?

---

# Multiple Conditions Example

Let's say we want observations from Oman after 1980 and through 2000.

--

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    filter(country == "Oman" &
           year >  1980 &
           year <= 2000 )
```

---
# `%in%` Operator

Common use case: Filter rows to things in some *set*.

We can use `%in%` like `==` but for matching *any element* in the vector on its right<sup>1</sup>. 

```{r}
former_yugoslavia <- c("Bosnia and Herzegovina", "Croatia", #<<
                       "Montenegro", "Serbia", "Slovenia") #<<
yugoslavia <- gapminder %>% filter(country %in% former_yugoslavia)
tail(yugoslavia, 2)
```

.footnote[[1] The `c()` function is how we make **vectors** in R, which are an important data type.]

---
## Sorting: `arrange()`

Along with filtering the data to see certain rows, we might want to sort it:

```{r}
yugoslavia %>% arrange(year, desc(pop))
```

The data are sorted by ascending `year` and descending `pop`.

---
## Keeping Columns: `select()`

Not only can we subset rows, but we can include specific columns (and put them in the order listed) using **`select()`**. 

```{r}
yugoslavia %>% select(country, year, pop) %>% head(4)
```

---
## Dropping Columns: `select()`


We can instead drop only specific columns with `select()` using `-` signs:

```{r}
yugoslavia %>% select(-continent, -pop, -lifeExp) %>% head(4)
```

---
## Helper Functions for `select()`


`select()` has a variety of helper functions like `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, and `matches()`, or can be given a range of contiguous columns `startvar:endvar`. See `?select` for details.

These are very useful if you have a "wide" data frame with column names following a pattern or ordering. 

![DYS Data Example](http://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/Lectures/Week3/img/dys_vars.PNG)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
DYS %>% select(starts_with("married"))
DYS %>% select(ends_with("18"))
```

---
## `select(where())`

An especially useful helper for select is `where()` which can be used for selecting columns based on functions that check column types.

```{r}
gapminder %>% select(where(is.numeric)) %>% head(3)
```

.pull-right[.footnote[`int` (integer) and `dbl` (double) are both types of `numeric` data.]]

--

```{r}
gapminder %>% select(where(is.factor)) %>% head(3)
```



---
## Renaming Columns with `select()`


We can rename columns using `select()`, but that drops everything that isn't mentioned:

```{r}
yugoslavia %>%
    select(Life_Expectancy = lifeExp) %>%
    head(4)
```

---
### Safer: Rename Columns with `rename()`


**`rename()`** renames variables using the same syntax as `select()` without dropping unmentioned variables.

```{r}
yugoslavia %>%
    select(country, year, lifeExp) %>%
    rename(Life_Expectancy = lifeExp) %>%
    head(4)
```

---
class: inverse
# Creating Variables

---
## `mutate()`

In `dplyr`, you can add new columns to a data frame using **`mutate()`**.


```{r}
yugoslavia %>% filter(country == "Serbia") %>%
    select(year, pop, lifeExp) %>%
    mutate(pop_million = pop / 1000000, #<<
           life_exp_past_40 = lifeExp - 40) %>% #<<
    head(5)
```

.footnote[Note you can create multiple variables in a single `mutate()` call by separating the expressions with commas.]

---
# `ifelse()`


A common function used in `mutate()` (and in general in R programming) is **`ifelse()`**. It returns a vector of values depending on a logical test.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ifelse(test = x==y, yes = first_value , no = second_value)
```

Output from `ifelse()` if `x==y` is...
* `TRUE`: `first_value` - the value for `yes =`

* `FALSE`: `second_value` - the value for `no = `

* `NA`: `NA` - because you can't test for NA with an equality!

--

For example:

```{r}
example <- c(1, 0, NA, -2)
ifelse(example > 0, "Positive", "Not Positive")
```

---
# `ifelse()` Example

.smallish[
```{r}
yugoslavia %>% mutate(short_country = 
                 ifelse(country == "Bosnia and Herzegovina", 
                        "B and H", as.character(country))) %>% #<<
    select(country, short_country, year, pop) %>%
    arrange(year, short_country) %>% head(3)
```
]

Read this as "For each row, if `country` equals 'Bosnia and Herzegovina, make `short_country` equal to 'B and H', otherwise make it equal to that row's value of `country`."

This is a simple way to change some values but not others!

Note: `country` is a factor--use `as.character()` to convert to character.

---
# `case_when()`

**`case_when()`** performs multiple `ifelse()` operations at the same time. `case_when()` allows you to create a new variable with values based on multiple logical statements. This is useful for making categorical variables or variables from combinations of other variables.
.smallish[
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdpPercap_ordinal = 
    case_when(
      gdpPercap <  700 ~ "low",
      gdpPercap >= 700 & gdpPercap < 800 ~ "moderate",
      TRUE ~ "high" )) %>% # Value when all other statements are FALSE
  slice(6:9) # get rows 6 through 9
```
]

---
class: inverse

# Analyses
## Basic Graphics and Models

---

# Histograms

We can use the `hist()` function to generate a histogram of a vector:

```{r, out.height="320px"}
hist(gapminder$lifeExp,
     xlab = "Life Expectancy (years)", #<<
     main = "Observed Life Expectancies of Countries") #<<
```

.pull-right[
.footnote[
`xlab =` is used to set the label of the x-axis of a plot.

`main = ` is used to set the title of a plot.

Use `?hist` to see additional options available for customizing a histogram.
]
]
---
# Scatter Plots

.small[
```{r, out.height="320px"}
plot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = gapminder, #<<
     xlab = "ln(GDP per Capita)",
     ylab = "Life Expectancy (years)",
     main = "Life Expectancy and log GDP per Capita",
     pch = 16, log="x") # log="x" sets x axis to log scale!
abline(h = mean(gapminder$lifeExp), col = "firebrick") #<<
abline(v = mean(gapminder$gdpPercap), col = "cornflowerblue") #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
.footnote[Note that `lifeExp ~ gdpPercap` is a **formula** of the type `y ~ x`. The first element (`lifeExp`) gets plotted on the y-axis and the second (`gdpPercap`) goes on the x-axis.

The `abline()` calls place horizontal (`h =`) or vertical (`v =`) lines at the means of the variables used in the plot. 
]
]

---
# Formulae

Most modeling functions in R use a common formula format—the same seen with the previous plot:

```{r}
new_formula <- y ~ x1 + x2 + x3
new_formula
class(new_formula)
```

The dependent variable goes on the left side of `~` and independent variables go on the right.

See here for more on [formulae](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-formula-tutorial).

---

# Simple Tables

`table()` creates basic cross-tabulations of vectors.

```{r}
table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$am)
```

---

# Chi-Square

We can give the output from `table()` to `chisq.test()` to perform a Chi-Square test of assocation.

```{r}
chisq.test(table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$am))
```

Note the warning here. You can use rescaled (`rescale.p=TRUE`) or simulated p-values (`simulate.p.value=TRUE`) if desired.

---

# T Tests

T tests for mean comparisons are simple to do.

```{r}
gapminder$post_1980 <- ifelse(gapminder$year > 1980, 1, 2)
t.test(lifeExp ~ post_1980, data=gapminder)
```

---

# Linear Models

We can run an ordinary least squares linear regression using `lm()`:

```{r}
lm(lifeExp~pop + gdpPercap + year + continent, data=gapminder)
```

Note we get a lot less output here than you may have expected! This is because we're only viewing a tiny bit of the information produced by `lm()`. We need to expore the object `lm()` creates!

---

# Model Summaries

The `summary()` function provides Stata-like regression output:

.smaller[
```{r}
lm_out <- lm(lifeExp~pop + gdpPercap + year + continent, data=gapminder)
summary(lm_out)
```
]

---

## Model Objects

`lm()` produces a lot more information than what is shown by `summary()` however. We can see the **str**ucture of `lm()` output using `str()`:

.smaller[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str(lm_out)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
str(lm_out, list.len=7, max.level=2) # list.len is used to 
```
]

.pull-right30[
.footnote[
`lm()` actually has an enormous quantity of output! This is a type of object called a **list**.
]
]
---

# Model Objects

We can access parts of `lm()` output using `$` like with dataframe names:

.small[
```{r}
lm_out$coefficients
```
]

We can also do this with `summary()`, which provides additional statistics:

.small[
```{r}
summary(lm_out)$coefficients
```
]

---

# ANOVA

ANOVAs can be fit and summarized just like `lm()`

```{r}
summary(aov(lifeExp ~ continent, data=gapminder))
```

---

# More Complex Models

R supports many more complex models, for example:

* `glm()` has syntax similar to `lm()` but adds a `family =` argument to specify model families and link functions like logistic regression
   + ex: `glm(x~y, family=binomial(link="logit"))`

* The `lme4` package adds hierarchical (multilevel) GLM models.

* `lavaan` fits structural equation models with intuitive syntax.

* `plm` and `tseries` fit time series models.

Most of these other packages support mode summaries with `summary()` and all create output objects which can be accessed using `$`.

Because R is the dominant environment for statisticians, the universe of modeling tools in R is *enormous*. If you need to do it, it is probably in a package somewhere.
